I'm a cosmologist and radio astronomer at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) focusing on mapping the large-scale structure of the Universe with radio surveys of the 21 cm line.

Most of my recent work has been with [CHIME](https://chime-experiment.ca), a novel radio interferometer designed for wide-field high sensitivity surveys.
